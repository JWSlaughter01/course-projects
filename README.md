## CS 1337 Computer Science I

"Review of control structures and data types with emphasis on structured data types. Applies the
object-oriented programming paradigm, focusing on the definition and use of classes along with
the fundamentals of object-oriented design. Includes basic analysis of algorithms, searching and
sorting techniques, and an introduction to software engineering. The programming language of
choice is C/C++." - Course Syllabus

All code for CS1337 was written in C++.

## CS 3345  Data Structures and Introduction to Algorithmic Analysis

"Analysis of algorithms including time complexity and Big-O notation. Analysis of stacks, queues,
and trees, including B-trees. Heaps, hashing, and advanced sorting techniques. Disjoint sets and
graphs. Course emphasizes design and implementation.)" - Course Syllabus

All code for CS 3345 was written in Java.

## CS 2325  Computer Organization

"The organization of computer systems is introduced using assembly language. Topics include basic 
concepts of computer architecture and organization, memory hierarchy, data types, computer arithmetic, 
control structures, interrupt handling, instruction sets, performance metrics, and the mechanics of 
testing and debugging computer systems. Embedded systems and device interfacing are introduced. 
Additionally, this class is taught with Intel assembly language." - Course Syllabus

All code for CS 2325 was written in Assembly for MASM

### :keyboard: Activity: Enable GitHub Pages

1. Open a new browser tab, and work on the steps in your second tab while you read the instructions in this tab.
1. Under your repository name, click **Settings**.
1. Click **Pages** in the **Code and automation** section.
1. Ensure "Deploy from a branch" is selected from the **Source** drop-down menu, and then select `main` from the **Branch** drop-down menu.
1. Click the **Save** button.
1. Wait about _one minute_ then refresh this page (the one you're following instructions from). [GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions) will automatically update to the next step.
   > Turning on GitHub Pages creates a deployment of your repository. GitHub Actions may take up to a minute to respond while waiting for the deployment. Future steps will be about 20 seconds; this step is slower.
   > **Note**: In the **Pages** of **Settings**, the **Visit site** button will appear at the top. Click the button to see your GitHub Pages site.
