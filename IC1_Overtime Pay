/*Get hourly pay rate & # of hours from the user, compute & output the # of regular hours, # of overtime hours & the weekly pay, subject to following conditions:

Do not pay for the extra hours beyond 50.
For the overtime hours (hours beyond regular 40 hours), pay at 1.5 times regular rate.
Here is one sample input & output:

Input hourly pay rate: 10
Input # of hours: 57
Regular hours: 40 Overtime hours: 10
Your weekly pay: 550
